# Export ArcGIS Server Tools

Various WIP tools used for exporting and collecting data on ArcGIS servers.

**Not much to see yet.**

#### Why?

Lots of cities and other government entities use ArcGIS tools. There are easy open data publishing tools that allow them to publish the data directly to an ArcGIS server. It'd be nice to be able to access and search across all of those ArcGIS servers!

#### What? 

Check out [Portland's ArcGIS portal](https://www.portlandmaps.com/arcgis/rest/services/Public).
